My name is André, and I specialize in creating and developing projects related to technology and IoTs. I enjoy learning programming languages such as Java, Python, systems like R studio, frameworks like Node.js, and databases like MySQL every day. Currently, I am studying at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, but I am open to any opportunities that may arise.
